- **OpenNESS 19.06.01** There are no non-Intel issues relevant to this release.
- **OpenNESS 19.06.01** 
   - VHOST HugePages dependency
   - Bug in getting appId by IP address for container
   - Wrong value of appliance verification key printed by ansible script
   - NTS is in hanging state when trying to add same traffic policy to multiple interfaces
   - Application in VM cannot be started
   - Bug in libvirt deployment
   - Invalid status after app undeployment
   - Application memory field is in MB
- **OpenNESS 19.12**
  - Improved usability/automation in Ansible scripts 
- **OpenNESS 20.03** 
  - Realtime Kernel support for network edge with K8s.
  - Modular playbooks  

# Known Issues and Limitations
- **OpenNESS 19.06** There are no issues relevant to this release.
- **OpenNESS 19.06.01** There is one issue relevant to this release: it is not possible to remove application from Edge Node in case of error during application deployment. The issue concerns application in Virtual Machine.
- **OpenNESS 19.09** 
  - Gateway in multi-node -  will not work when few nodes will have the same public IP (they will be behind one common NAT)
  - Ansible in K8s can cause problems when rerun on a machine: 
    - If after running all 3 scripts 
    - Script 02 will be run again (it will not remove all necessary K8s related artifacts)
    - We would recommend cleaning up the installation on the node
- **OpenNESS 19.12** 
  - Gateway in multi-node -  will not work when few nodes will have the same public IP (they will be behind one common NAT)
  - OpenNESS OnPremises: Can not remove a failed/disconnected the edge node information/state from the controller
  - The CNCA APIs (4G & 5G) supported in this release is an early access reference implementation and does not support authentication 
  - Realtime kernel support has been temporarily disabled to address the Kubernetes 1.16.2 and Realtime kernel instability. 
- **OpenNESS 20.03** 
  - On-Premises edge installation takes more than 1.5hrs because of docker image build for OVS-DPDK 
  - Network edge installation takes more than 1.5hrs because of docker image build for OVS-DPDK
  - OpenNESS controller allows management NICs to be in the pool of configuration which might allow configuration by mistake there by disconnecting the node from master
  - When using the SRIOV EPA feature added in 20.03 with OVNCNI, the container cannot access the CNI port. This is due to the SRIOV port being set by changing the network used by the container from default to a custom network, This overwrites the OVNCNI network setting configured prior to this to enable the container to work with OVNCNI. Another issue with the SRIOV, is that this also overwrites the network configuration with the EAA and edgedns, agents, which prevents the SRIOV enabled container from communicating with the agents.
  - Cannot remove Edge Node from Controller when its offline and traffic policy is configured or app is deployed.
