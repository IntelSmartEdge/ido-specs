# OpenNESS OnPremises - Enhanced Platform Awareness Features supported 
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Features](#features)

## Overview 
Enhanced Platform Awareness features are supported in OnPremises using EVA APIs. The flow looks like this:
1. From the OpenNESS controller UI user would use create the HTTP REST POST API to set the required EPA features (from the list of supported) for a given application. Key=value methodology is used for this. 
2. Controller send the API over gRPC to the EVA agent on the Edge node 
3. EVA APIs has Enhanced Application Configuration (EAC) handler that will detect if the EPA feature is requested for Application running in a VM or Container. Once this is done required configuration is generated by the EVA agent. 
4. Application is started (VM or Container based)
