# OpenNESS Network Edge - Enhanced Platform Awareness Features Supported
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Features](#features)

## Overview 
Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) features are supported in on-premises using Kubernetes\* infrastructure. Some of the EPA features are supported as Kubernetes jobs, some as daemon sets, some as normal pods, and some as Kubernetes device plugins. The overall objective of EPA for network edge is to expose the platform capability to the edge cloud orchestrator for better performance, consistency, and reliability.  

## Features 
The following EPA features are supported in Open Network Edge Services Software (OpenNESS) Network Edge:
