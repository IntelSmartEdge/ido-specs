# Quickstart
The following is a complete set of actions that need to be completed to successfully set up OpenNESS cluster.

1. Fulfill the [Preconditions](#preconditions).
2. Become familiar with [supported features](#supported-epa-features) and enable them if desired.
3. Run the [deployment helper script](#running-playbooks) for the Ansible playbook:

   ```shell
   ./deploy_ne.sh
   ```

# Preconditions

In order to use the playbooks several preconditions must be fulfilled. These preconditions are described in the section [Q&A](#qa) below. The preconditions are:

- Hosts for  the Edge Controller (Kubernetes master) and Edge Nodes (Kubernetes workers) must have proper and unique hostnames (not `localhost`). This hostname must be specified in `/etc/hosts` (refer to [Setup static hostname](#setup-static-hostname)).

- SSH keys must be exchanged between hosts (refer to [Exchanging SSH keys between hosts](#exchanging-ssh-keys-between-hosts)).

- A proxy may need to be set (refer to [Setting proxy](#setting-proxy)).

- If a private repository is used, a Github token must be set up (refer to [GitHub Token](#github-token)).

- Refer to [Configuring time](#configuring-time) section for checking how to enable installing Network Time Protocol (NTP) clients.

- The Ansible inventory must be configured (refer to [Configuring inventory](#configuring-inventory)).

# Running playbooks

The Network Edge deployment and cleanup is carried out via Ansible playbooks. The playbooks are run from the Ansible host (it might be the same machine as the Edge Controller). Prior to running the playbooks, an inventory file `inventory.ini` must be configured.

The following subsections describe the playbooks in more detail.

## Deployment Scripts

For convenience, playbooks can be executed by running helper deployment scripts from the Ansible host. These scripts require that the Edge Controller and Edge Nodes be configured on different hosts (for deployment on single node please refer to [Single-node Network Edge cluster](#single-node-network-edge-cluster)). This is done by configuring the Ansible playbook inventory, as described later on.

The command syntax for the scripts is: `action_mode.sh [-f flavor] [group]`, i.e.,

  - `deploy_ne.sh [-f flavor] [ controller | nodes ]`
  - `cleanup_ne.sh [-f flavor] [ controller | nodes ] `

The parameter `controller` or `nodes` in each case deploys or cleans up the Edge Controller or the Edge Nodes respectively.

For an initial installation, `deploy_ne.sh controller` must be run before `deploy_ne.sh nodes`. During an initial installation, the hosts may reboot. After reboot, the deployment script that was last run should be run again.

The `cleanup_ne.sh` script is used when a configuration error in the Edge Controller or Edge Nodes must be fixed. The script causes the appropriate installation to be reverted, so that the error can be fixed and `deploy_ne.sh` rerun. `cleanup_ne.sh` does not do a comprehensive cleanup (e.g., installation of DPDK or Golang will not be rolled back).

## Network Edge Playbooks

The `network_edge.yml` and `network_edge_cleanup.yml` files contain playbooks for Network Edge mode.
Playbooks can be customized by enabling and configuring features in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml` file.

### Cleanup playbooks

The role of the cleanup playbook is to revert changes made by deploy playbooks.
Changes are reverted by going step by step in reverse order and undoing the steps.

For example, when installing Docker, the RPM repository is added and Docker installed, when cleaning up - Docker is uninstalled and then repository is removed.

Note that there might be some leftovers created by installed software; for example, DPDK and Golang installations, found in `/opt`, are not rolled back.

### Supported EPA features

A number of enhanced platform capabilities/features are available in OpenNESS for Network Edge. For the full list of features supported see [Enhanced Platform Awareness Features](supported-epa). The documents referenced in this list provide detailed description of the features, and step by step instructions for to enabling them. The user is advised to become familiar with the features available before executing the deployment playbooks.

### VM support for Network Edge
Support for VM deployment on OpenNESS for Network Edge is available and enabled by default. Certain configurations and pre-requisites may need to be satisfied in order to use all VM capabilities. The user is advised to become familiar with the VM support documentation before executing the deployment playbooks. Please see [openness-network-edge-vm-support](../../applications-onboard/openness-network-edge-vm-support) for more information.

### Application on-boarding

Please refer to [network-edge-applications-onboarding](../../applications-onboard/network-edge-applications-onboarding) document for instructions on how to deploy edge applications for OpenNESS Network Edge.

### Single-node Network Edge cluster

Network Edge can be deployed on just a single machine working as a master & worker.<br>
In order to deploy Network Edge in single-node cluster scenario follow the steps:
1. Modify `inventory.ini`<br>
   > Rules for inventory:
   > - IP address (`ansible_host`) for both controller and node must be the same
   > - `edgenode_group` and `controller_group` groups must contain exactly one host

   Example of a valid inventory:
   ```ini
   [all]
   controller ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_host=192.168.0.11
   node01     ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_host=192.168.0.11

   [controller_group]
   controller

   [edgenode_group]
   node01

   [edgenode_vca_group]
   ```
2. Features can be enabled in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml` file by tweaking the configuration variables.
3. Settings regarding the kernel, grub, hugepages & tuned can be customized in `group_vars/edgenode_group/10-open.yml`.
   > Default settings in single-node cluster mode are those of the Edge Node, i.e. kernel & tuned customization enabled.
4. Single-node cluster can be deployed by running command: `./deploy_ne.sh single`

## Docker Registry

Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker Images. On OpenNESS environment, Docker registry service deployed as a pod on Master Node. Docker Registry authentication enabled with self-signed certificates and all worker and master node will have access to docker registry.

### Deploy Docker Registry

Ansible "docker_registry" roles created on openness-experience-kits. For deploying docker registry on Kubernetes master node roles are enabled on openness-experience-kits "network_edge.yml" file.

 ```ini
  role: docker_registry/master
  role: docker_registry/worker
   ```
Following steps are processed during the docker registry deploy on openness setup.

* Generate a self-signed certificate on Kubernetes Master Node.
* Build and Deploy docker-registry pod on the Master Node.
* Generate client.key and client.csr key on the worker node
* Authenticate client.csr for server access.
* Share public key and client.cert on trusted Worker Node and ansible build Host location
  /etc/docker/certs.d/<Kubernetes_Master_IP: port>
* After the docker registry deploy successfully Worker Node and Ansible host can access the private docker registry.
* IP address of docker registry will be: "Kubernetes_Master_IP"
* Port no of docker registry will be: 5000

### Docker registry image push
Use the docker tag to create an alias of the image with the fully qualified path to your docker registry after tag success push image on docker registry.

 ```ini
  docker tag nginx:latest Kubernetes_Master_IP:5000/nginx:latest
  docker push Kubernetes_Master_IP:5000/nginx:latest
   ```
Now image tag with the fully qualified path to your private registry, you can push the image to the registry using docker push command.

### Docker registry image pull
Use the docker pull command to pull the image from docker registry:

 ```ini
  docker pull Kubernetes_Master_IP:5000/nginx:latest
   ```
> NOTE: <Kubernetes_Master_IP> should be replaced as per our docker registry IP address.


## Kubernetes cluster networking plugins (Network Edge)

Kubernetes uses 3rd party networking plugins to provide [cluster networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/).
These plugins are based on [CNI (Container Network Interface) specification](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni).

OpenNESS Experience Kits provide several ready-to-use Ansible roles deploying CNIs.
The following CNIs are currently supported:

* [kube-ovn](https://github.com/alauda/kube-ovn)
  * **Only as primary CNI**
  * CIDR: 10.16.0.0/16
* [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel)
  * IPAM: host-local
  * CIDR: 10.244.0.0/16
  * Network attachment definition: openness-flannel
* [calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/cni-plugin)
  * IPAM: host-local
  * CIDR: 10.243.0.0/16
  * Network attachment definition: openness-calico
* [weavenet](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave)
  * CIDR: 10.32.0.0/12
* [SR-IOV](https://github.com/intel/sriov-cni) (cannot be used as a standalone or primary CNI - [sriov setup](../../../doc/enhanced-platform-awareness/openness-sriov-multiple-interfaces))
* [Userspace](https://github.com/intel/userspace-cni-network-plugin) (cannot be used as a standalone or primary CNI - [Userspace CNI setup](../../../doc/dataplane/openness-userspace-cni)

Multiple CNIs can be requested to be set up for the cluster. To provide such functionality [the Multus CNI](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni) is used.

> NOTE: For a guide on how to add new CNI role to the OpenNESS Experience Kits refer to [the OpenNESS Experience Kits guide](../openness-experience-kits#adding-new-cni-plugins-for-kubernetes-network-edge)

### Selecting cluster networking plugins (CNI)

The default CNI for OpenNESS is kube-ovn. Non-default CNIs may be configured with OpenNESS by editing the file `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`.
To add a non-default CNI, the following edits must be carried out:

- The CNI name is added to the `kubernetes_cnis` variable. The CNIs are applied in the order in which they appear in the file. By default, `kube-ovn` is defined, i.e.

  ```yaml
  kubernetes_cnis:
  - kubeovn
  ```

- To add an additional CNI, such as SR-IOV, the `kubernetes_cnis` variable is edited as follows:

  ```yaml
  kubernetes_cnis:
  - kubeovn
  - sriov
  ```

- The Multus CNI is added by ansible playbook when two or more CNIs are defined in the `kubernetes_cnis` variable
- The CNI's networks (CIDR for pods, and other CIDRs used by the CNI) are added to the `proxy_noproxy` variable by ansible playbooks.

### Adding additional interfaces to pods

In order to add additional interface from secondary CNIs annotation is required.
Below is an example pod yaml file for a scenario with `kube-ovn` as a primary CNI and `calico` and `flannel` as additional CNIs.
Multus will create an interface named `calico` using network attachment definition `openness-calico` and interface `flannel` using network attachment definition `openness-flannel`.
Note that additional annotations such as `openness-calico@calico` are required only if the CNI is secondary. If the CNI is primary, the interface will be added automatically by multus.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: cni-test-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: openness-calico@calico, openness-flannel@flannel
spec:
  containers:
  - name: cni-test-pod
    image: docker.io/centos/tools:latest
    command:
    - /sbin/init
```

The following is an example output of the `ip a` command run in a pod, after CNIs have been applied. Some lines in the command output were omitted for readability.

The following interfaces are available: `calico@if142`, `flannel@if143` and `eth0@if141` (`kubeovn`).

```shell
# kubectl exec -ti cni-test-pod ip a

1: lo:
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo

2: tunl0@NONE:
    link/ipip 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0

4: calico@if142:
    inet 10.243.0.3/32 scope global calico

6: flannel@if143:
    inet 10.244.0.3/16 scope global flannel

140: eth0@if141:
    inet 10.16.0.5/16 brd 10.16.255.255 scope global eth0
```

# Q&A

## Configuring time

OpenNESS requires system time to be synchronized among all nodes and controllers in a system, in order to allow for correct certificate verification.

OpenNESS provides possibility to synchronize machine's time with NTP server.
To enable NTP synchronization change `ntp_enable` in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`:
```yaml
ntp_enable: true
```

Servers to be used instead of default ones can be provided using `ntp_servers` variable in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`:
```yaml
ntp_servers: ["ntp.local.server"]
```

## Setup static hostname

The following command is used in CentOS to set a static hostname:

```shell
hostnamectl set-hostname <host_name>
```

The hostname must be defined in `/etc/host` as well, as in the following example:

```shell
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4 <host_name>
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6 <host_name>
```

In addition to being a unique hostname within the cluster, the hostname must also follow Kubernetes naming conventions, e.g., only lower-case alphanumeric characters, "-", or ".", start and end with an alphanumeric character. Refer to
[K8s naming restrictions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names) for additional detail on these conventions.

## Configuring inventory

In order to execute playbooks, `inventory.ini` must be configured to specify the hosts on which the playbooks are executed.

OpenNESS' inventory contains three groups: `all`, `edgenode_group`, and `controller_group`:

- `all` contains all the hosts (with configuration) used in any playbook.
- `controller_group` contains host to be set up as a Kubernetes master / OpenNESS Edge Controller \
**WARNING: Since only one Controller is supported, `controller_group` can contain only 1 host.**
- `edgenode_group` contains hosts to be set up as a Kubernetes workers / OpenNESS Edge Nodes. \
**NOTE: All nodes will be joined to the master specified in `controller_group`.**

In the `all` group, the user can specify all of the hosts for usage in other groups.
Example: the `all` group looks like:

```ini
[all]
ctrl ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_host=<host_ip_address>
node1 ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_host=<host_ip_address>
node2 ansible_ssh_user=root ansible_host=<host_ip_address>
```

The user can then use the specified hosts in `edgenode_group` and `controller_group`, i.e.:

```ini
[edgenode_group]
node1
node2

[controller_group]
ctrl
```

## Exchanging SSH keys between hosts

Exchanging SSH keys between hosts permits password-less SSH connection from the host running Ansible to the hosts being set up.

In the first step, the host running Ansible (usually the Edge Controller host) must have a generated SSH key. The SSH key can be generated by executing `ssh-keygen` and obtaining the key from the output of the command.

The following is an example of a key generation, in which the key is placed in the default directory (`/root/.ssh/id_rsa`), and an empty passphrase is used.

```shell
# ssh-keygen

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):  <ENTER>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  <ENTER>
Enter same passphrase again:  <ENTER>
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:vlcKVU8Tj8nxdDXTW6AHdAgqaM/35s2doon76uYpNA0 root@host
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|          .oo.==*|
|     .   .  o=oB*|
|    o . .  ..o=.=|
|   . oE.  .  ... |
|      ooS.       |
|      ooo.  .    |
|     . ...oo     |
|      . .*o+.. . |
|       =O==.o.o  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

In the second step, the generated key must be copied to **every host from the inventory**, including the host on which the key was generated, if it appears in the inventory (e.g., if the playbooks are executed from the Edge Controller host, the host must also have a copy of its key). It is done by running `ssh-copy-id`, e.g.:

```shell
# ssh-copy-id root@host

/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
The authenticity of host '<IP> (<IP>)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:c7EroVdl44CaLH/IOCBu0K0/MHl8ME5ROMV0AGzs8mY.
ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:38:c8:03:d6:5a:8e:f7:7d:bd:37:a0:f1:08:15:28:bb.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@host's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@host'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

To make sure key is copied successfully, try to SSH to the host: `ssh 'root@host'`. It should not ask for the password.

## Setting proxy

If proxy is required in order to connect to the Internet, it is configured via the following steps:

-  Edit the `proxy_` variables in the `group_vars/all/10-open.yml` file.
-  Set the `proxy_enable` variable in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml` file to `true`.
-  Append the network CIDR (e.g., `192.168.0.1/24`) to the `proxy_noproxy` variable in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`.

Sample configuration of `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`:

```yaml
# Setup proxy on the machine - required if the Internet is accessible via proxy
proxy_enable: true
# Clear previous proxy settings
proxy_remove_old: true
# Proxy URLs to be used for HTTP, HTTPS and FTP
proxy_http: "http://proxy.example.org:3128"
proxy_https: "http://proxy.example.org:3129"
proxy_ftp: "http://proxy.example.org:3128"
# Proxy to be used by YUM (/etc/yum.conf)
proxy_yum: "{{ proxy_http }}"
# No proxy setting contains addresses and networks that should not be accessed using proxy (e.g. local network, Kubernetes CNI networks)
proxy_noproxy: ""
```

Sample definition of `no_proxy` environmental variable for Ansible host (to allow Ansible host to connect to other hosts):

```shell
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,10.244.0.0/24,10.96.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/24"
```

## Obtaining Installation Files

There are no specific restrictions on the directory into which the OpenNESS directories are cloned. When OpenNESS is built, additional directories will be installed in `/opt`. It is recommended to clone the project into a directory such as `/home`.

## Setting Git

### GitHub Token

> NOTE: Only required when cloning private repositories. Not needed when using github.com/open-ness repositories.

In order to clone private repositories, a GitHub token must be provided.

To generate GitHub token, refer to [GitHub help - Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

To provide the token, edit the value of `git_repo_token` variable in in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml`.

### Customize tag/branch/sha to checkout

Specific tag, branch or commit SHA can be checked out by setting the `controller_repository_branch` and the `edgenode_repository_branch` variables in `group_vars/all/10-open.yml` for Edge Nodes and Kubernetes master / Edge Controller respectively.

```yaml
controller_repository_branch: master
edgenode_repository_branch: master
# or
controller_repository_branch: openness-20.03
edgenode_repository_branch: openness-20.03
```

## Installing Kubernetes Dashboard

Kubernetes does not ship with a graphical interface by default, but a web-based tool called [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) can be installed with a few simple steps. Kubernetes Dashboard allows users to manage the cluster and the edge applications.

Kubernetes dashboard can only be installed with Network Edge deployments.

Follow the below steps to install the Kubernetes dashboard after OpenNESS is installed through [playbooks](#running-playbooks).

1. Deploy the dashboard using `kubectl`:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
    ```

2. Get all the pods in all namespaces:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces
    ```

3. Create a new service account with the cluster admin:

    ```shell
    cat > dashboard-admin-user.yaml << EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: admin-user
      namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: admin-user
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cluster-admin
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: admin-user
      namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
    EOF
    ```

4. Apply the admin user:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f dashboard-admin-user.yaml
    ```

5. Edit kubernetes-dashboard service through the following command,

    ```shell
    kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard edit service kubernetes-dashboard
    ```

    Add `externalIPs` to the service spec, replace `<controller-ip>` with the actual controller IP address:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      externalIPs:
      - <controller-ip>
    ```

    > **OPTIONAL**: By default the dashboard is accessible at port 443, it can be changed by editing the port value `- port: <port>` in the service spec.

6. Verify that the `kubernetes-dashboard` service has `EXTERNAL-IP` assigned:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get service kubernetes-dashboard
    ```

7. Open the dashboard from the browser at `https://<controller-ip>/`. If the port was changed according to the OPTIONAL note at step 5, then use `https://<controller-ip>:<port>/` instead.

    > **NOTE**: Firefox browser can be an alternative to Chrome and Internet Explorer in case the dashboard web page is blocked due to certification issue.

8. Capture the bearer token using this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe secret $(kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')
    ```

Paste the Token in the browser to log in as shown in this diagram:

![Dashboard Login](controller-edge-node-setup-images/dashboard-login.png)

_Figure - Kubernetes Dashboard Login_

9. Go to the OpenNESS Controller installation directory and edit the `.env` file with the dashboard link `INFRASTRUCTURE_UI_URL=https://<controller-ip>:<port>/` in order to get it integrated with the OpenNESS controller UI:

    ```shell
    cd /opt/edgecontroller/
    vi .env
    ```

10. Build the OpenNESS Controller UI:

    ```shell
    cd /opt/edgecontroller/
    make ui-up
    ```

11. The OpenNESS controller landing page is accessible at `http://<LANDING_UI_URL>/`.
    > **NOTE**: `LANDING_UI_URL` can be retrieved from `.env` file.


## Customization of kernel, grub parameters and tuned profile

OpenNESS Experience Kits provide an easy way to customize the kernel version, grub parameters and tuned profile. For more information, refer to [the OpenNESS Experience Kits guide](../openness-experience-kits).
