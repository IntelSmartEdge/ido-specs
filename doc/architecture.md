## Architecture Overview 

Before reviewing the detailed architecture overview of OpenNESS, take a look at the logical overview of how the OpenNESS Building Blocks are laid out. 

### Logical 

The OpenNESS solution is built on top of Kubernetes, which is a production-grade container orchestration environment. A typical OpenNESS-based deployment consists of an **OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane** and an **OpenNESS Edge Node**.

![](arch-images/openness_overview.png)

**OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane**: This node consists of microservices and Kubernetes extensions, enhancements, and optimizations that provide the functionality to configure one or more OpenNESS Edge Nodes and the application services that run on those nodes (Application Pod Placement, Configuration of Core Network, etc). 

**OpenNESS Edge Node**: This node consists of microservices and Kubernetes extensions, enhancements, and optimizations that are needed for edge application and network function deployments. It also consists of APIs that are often used for the discovery of application services. 

Another key ingredient is the 4G/5G core network functions that enable a private or public edge. OpenNESS uses reference network functions to validate this end-to-end edge deployment. This is key to understanding and measuring edge Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).  

### Architecture 

![](arch-images/openness-arc.png)

#### OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane

The OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane consists of Vanilla Kubernetes Control Plane components along with OpenNESS microservices that interact with the Kubernetes Control Plane using Kubernetes defined APIs. 

The following are the high-level features of the OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane building blocks:

- Configuration of the hardware platform that hosts applications and network functions 
- Configuration of network functions (4G, 5G, and WiFi\*)
- Detection of various hardware and software capabilities of the edge cluster and use for scheduling applications and network functions 
- Setup of network and DNS policies for applications and network functions 
- Enable collection of hardware infrastructure, software, and application monitoring 
- Expose edge cluster capabilities northbound to a controller

#### OpenNESS Edge Node 

The OpenNESS Edge Node consists of Vanilla Kubernetes Node components along with OpenNESS Building Blocks that interact with Kubernetes node using Kubernetes defined APIs.

The following are the high-level features of the OpenNESS Kubernetes node building blocks:

- Container runtime (Docker\*) and virtualization infrastructure (libvirt\*, Open vSwitch (OVS)\*, etc.) support
- Platform pods consisting of services that enable the configuration of a node for a particular deployment, device plugins enabling hardware resource allocation to an application pod, and detection of interfaces and reporting to the Control Plane.
- System pods consisting of services that enable reporting the hardware and software features of each node to the Control Plane, resource isolation service for pods, and providing a DNS service to the cluster 
- Telemetry consisting of services that enable hardware, operating system, infrastructure, and application-level telemetry for the edge node 
- Support for real-time kernel for low latency applications and network functions like 4G and 5G base station and non-real-time kernel 

The OpenNESS Network functions are the key 4G and 5G functions that enable edge cloud deployment. OpenNESS provides these key reference network functions and the configuration agent in the Intel Distribution of OpenNESS.  

The OpenNESS solution validates the functionality and performance of key software development kits used for applications and network functions at the edge. This spans across edge applications that use Intel® Media SDK, OpenVINO™, Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL), etc. and network functions that use Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), Intel® Performance Primitives, Intel® MKL, OpenMP\*, OpenCL\*, etc.

## Building Blocks, Kubernetes Extensions, and Enhancements

This section provides of an overview of the various OpenNESS Building Blocks, extensions to Kubernetes and enhancements to other open source frameworks required for the development of Edge platforms. These building blocks span across the system and platform pods discussed earlier. Many are provided as Helm charts.

### Multi-Access Networking

This building block represents a set of microservices that enables steering of traffic from various access networks to and from edge apps and services. 

- **Application Function (AF):** is a microservice in the OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane that supports Traffic Influencing Subscription, Packet Flow Description Management functionality, and Policy Authorization to help steer the Edge-specific traffic in UPF towards the applications deployed on the OpenNESS edge node. AF is developed as per the Rel.15 3gpp specifications.  
- **Network Exposure Function (NEF)**: is a microservice used for validation of AF functionality in OpenNESS before integrating with the 5G Core.  The functionality is limited and in line with the AF functional scope. It includes a reference implementation for Traffic influence and PFD management. NEF is developed as per the Rel.15 3gpp specifications.  
- **Core Network Configuration Agent (CNCA)**: is a microservice that provides an interface for orchestrators that interact with OpenNESS Kubernetes Control Plane to interact with the 5G Core network solution. CNCA provides a CLI (kube-ctl plugin) interface to interact with the AF and OAM services. 
- **Edge Application Agent (EAA)**: Edge application APIs are implemented by the EAA. Edge application APIs are important APIs for edge application developers. EAA APIs provide APIs for service discovery, subscription, and update notification. EAA APIs are based on ETSI MEC- MEC11 MP1 APIs specifications.
- **Edge Interface Service**: This service is an application that runs in a Kubernetes pod on each node of the OpenNESS Kubernetes cluster. It allows attachment of additional network interfaces of the node host to provide an OVS bridge, enabling external traffic scenarios for applications deployed in Kubernetes pods. Services on each node can be controlled from the Control Plane using a kubectl plugin. This interface service can attach both kernel and userspace (DPDK) network interfaces to OVS bridges of a suitable type.
- **DNS Service**: Supports DNS resolution and forwarding services for the application deployed on edge computing. The DNS server is implemented based on the DNS library in Go. DNS service supports resolving DNS requests from user equipment (UE) and applications on the edge cloud.  

### Edge Multi-Cluster Orchestration

Edge Multi-Cluster Orchestration(EMCO), is a Geo-distributed application orchestrator for Kubernetes*. The main objective of EMCO is automation of the deployment of applications and services across clusters. It acts as a central orchestrator that can manage edge services and network functions across geographically distributed edge clusters from different third parties. Finally, the resource orchestration within a cluster of nodes will leverage Kubernetes* and Helm charts.

### Resource Management

Resource Management represents a methodology which involves identification of the hardware and software resources on the edge cluster, Configuration and allocation of the resources and continuous monitoring of the resources for any changes.

![](arch-images/resource.png)

OpenNESS provides set of enhancements across multiple layers of the orchestration stack, targeting identification of platform capabilities as well as configuration and capacity consumption. 

Why should users consider using Resource Management? To achieve optimal performance and efficiency characteristics. Resource Management extensions facilitate the automation of an advanced selection of capabilities and tuning parameters during the deployment of cloud-native solutions. Resource Management also enables service providers to offer differentiating and/or revenue-generating services that require leveraging specific hardware features.

OpenNESS provides a complete solution for users to integrate key resource management features needed for applications (CDN, AI inference, transcoding, gaming, etc.) and CNFs (RAN DU, CU, and Core) to work optimally for edge deployments.

#### Resource Identification

Resource identification involves detecting key hardware and software features on the platform that can be used for scheduling of the workload on the cluster. OpenNESS support Node Feature Discovery (NFD) microservices that detects hardware and software features and labels the nodes with relevant features. 

#### Resource Allocation

Resource Allocation involves configuration of the certain hardware resources like CPU, IO devices, GPU, Accelerator devices, Memory (Hugepages) etc.. to the applications and services. OpenNESS provides many Device Plugins, Kubernetes jobs, CRD Operators and Red Hat OpenShift Operator: Special Resource Operators for configuration and resource allocation of VPU, GPU, FPGA, CPU L3 cache, Memory bandwidth resources to applications and services. 

#### Resource Monitoring

Resource monitoring involves tracking the usage of allocated resources to the applications and services and also tracking the remaining allocatable resources. OpenNESS provides collectors, node exporters using collectd, telegraf and custom exporters as part of telemetry and monitoring of current resource usage. Resource monitoring support is provided for CPU, VPU, FPGA AND Memory.
