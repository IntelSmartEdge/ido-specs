## OpenNESS Distributions
OpenNESS is released as two distributions:
1. <b>OpenNESS </b>: A full Open Source distribution of OpenNESS
2. <b>Intel Distribution of OpenNESS </b>: A licensed distribution from Intel that includes all the features in OpenNESS along with additional microservices, Kubernetes extensions, enhancements and optimizations for Intel Architecture. 

The Intel Distribution of OpenNESS requires a secure login to the OpenNESS Github. To gain access to the Intel Distribution of OpenNESS, please contact your Intel support representative. 

## Deployment based on Location
OpenNESS supports deployment of edge nodes that host Applications and Network functions at following locations. 

![](arch-images/locations.png)

<b>On-Premises </b> : The Edge Computing resources are located in the customer premises (e.g. Industrial, Retail, Healthcare) and managed by the Communication Service Provider (CoSP) or by the Enterprise customer as a Private network (Private 4G/5G, uCPE/SDWAN). These deployments retain the sensitive data generated on-premises. 

<b>Network Edge </b>: The Edge compute resources are typically spread across the CoSP network (e.g. Access Edge - Cell site, Near Edge - Aggregation Sites and Central Office - Regional Data Center) and managed by the CoSP. Adoption of 5G has paved the way for cloud native COTS deployments that host Network Functions and Applications.  

Most of these deployments are fully virtualized and moving towards cloud native platforms for agility and elasticity. 

## Architecture overview 

Before we look at the detailed Architecture overview of OpenNESS, let's look at a logical overview of how the OpenNESS microservices are laid out. 

### Logical 
The OpenNESS solution is built on top of Kubernetes which is a production grade container orchestration environment. A typical OpenNESS based deployment consists of an OpenNESS Kubernetes Master Node and OpenNESS Edge node.

![](arch-images/openness_overview.png)

The OpenNESS Kubernetes Master node consists of microservices and Kubernetes extensions, enhancements/optimizations that provide functionality to configure one or more OpenNESS Edge nodes and the application services that run on those nodes. E.g. Application Pod Placement, Configuration of Core Network, etc. 

The OpenNESS Edge node consists of microservices, and Kubernetes extensions, enhancements/optimizations that are needed for Edge Application and Network function deployment. It also consists of APIs that are typically used for discovery of Application services. 

Another key ingredient is the 4G/5G Core network functions that enable Private or Public edge. OpenNESS uses reference network functions to validate this end-to-end edge deployment. This is key to understating and measuring the Edge Key Performance Indicators (KPI).  

### Architecture 

![](arch-images/openness-arc.png)

The OpenNESS Kubernetes Master node consists of vanilla Kubernetes Master node components along with OpenNESS microservices that interact with the Kubernetes Master node using Kubernetes defined APIs. The following are the high level functionalities of the OpenNESS Kubernetes Master microservice:
- Configuration of the hardware platform that hosts applications and network functions 
- Configuration of the Network functions (4G, 5G, Wifi)
- Detection of various hardware and software capabilities of the edge cluster and using for scheduling applications and network functions 
- Setup of network and DNS policies for applications and network functions 
- Enable collection of hardware infrastructure, software and application monitoring 
- Expose edge cluster capabilities northbound to a controller

The OpenNESS Edge node consists of vanilla Kubernetes node components along with OpenNESS microservices that interact with Kubernetes node using Kubernetes defined APIs. The following are the high level functionalities of the OpenNESS Kubernetes node microservice:
- Container runtime (docker), Virtualization infrastructure (libvirt, OVS, etc.) support 
- Platform Pods consisting of services that enables configuration of a node for a particular deployment, device plugins enabling hardware resources allocation to an application pod and detection of interfaces and reporting to the Master node.
- System Pods consisting of services that enable reporting the hardware and software features of each node to the master, resource isolation service for pods and providing a DNS service to the cluster 
- Telemetry consisting of services that enable hardware, operating system, infrastructure and application level telemetry for the edge node 
- Support for real-time kernel for low latency applications and network functions like 4G and 5G base station and non-real time kernel 
 
The OpenNESS Network functions are the key 4G and 5G functions that enable edge cloud deployment. OpenNESS provides these key reference network functions and the configuration agent in the Intel Distribution of OpenNESS.  

The OpenNESS solution validates functionality and performance of key Software Development Kits used for applications and network functions at the edge. This spans across edge applications that use Media SDK, AI/ML SDK, Math SDKs etc. and Network functions that use DPDK, Intel Performance Primitives, Math SDK, OpenMP, OpenCL, etc.

## Microservices, Kubernetes extensions and Enhancements  

OpenNESS Microservices and Enhancements can be understood under the following sub-classification. All OpenNESS microservices are provided as Helm charts. 

#### Platform Pods - Enhanced Platform Awareness 
Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) represents a methodology and a related set of enhancements across multiple layers of the orchestration stack, targeting intelligent platform capabilities, configuration & capacity consumption. EPA features include Huge Pages support, NUMA topology awareness, CPU pinning, integration with OVS-DPDK, support for I/O Pass-through via SR-IOV, HDDL support, FPGA resource allocation support and many others. 

So why should one consider using EPA? To achieve the optimal performance and efficiency characteristics, EPA extensions to Data Models, Orchestrators and VIMs facilitates the automation of an advanced selection of capabilities and tuning parameters during the deployment of NFV solutions. EPA also enables service providers to offer differentiating and/or revenue generating services that require leveraging of specific hardware features.

OpenNESS provides a one-stop solution to integrate key EPA features that are critical for Applications (CDN, AI Inference, Transcoding, Gaming etc.) and CNFs (RAN DU, CU and Core) to work optimally for edge deployments.

## OpenNESS Experience Kit 

OpenNESS Experience Kit is an Ansible playbook which acts a single interface for users to deploy OpenNESS. The Experience Kit organizes all of the above microservices, Kubernetes extensions, enhancements and optimizations under easy to deploy node types called <b>Flavors</b>, implemented as Ansible Roles.

For example, a user deploying a network edge at cell site can choose the RAN flavor to deploy a node with all the microservices, Kubernetes extensions, enhancements and optimizations required for a RAN node. 

### Minimal flavor  
This flavor supports the installation of the minimal set of components from OpenNESS. Typically used as a starting point for creating custom node. 

### RAN node flavor 
RAN node here typically refers to RAN DU and CU 4G/5G nodes deployed on the edge or far edge. In some cases DU may be integrated in to the radio. The example RAN deployment flavor uses FlexRAN as a reference DU. 

![RAN node flavor](arch-images/openness-flexran.png)

### Core node flavor 
Core nodes here typically refer to User plane and Control plane Core workloads for 4G and 5G deployed on the edge and central location. In most edge deployments, UPF/SPGW-U plane is located on the edge along with the applications and services. For the ease of representation, the following diagram shows how OpenNESS can be used to deploy both User plane and Control plane Core nodes. Both User plane and Control plane are supported as separate flavors.
