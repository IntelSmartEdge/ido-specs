## CERA Minimal Flavor

The pre-defined *minimal* deployment flavor provisions the minimal set of configurations for bringing up the OpenNESS network edge deployment.

The following are steps to install this flavor:
1. Configure the CEEK as described in the [OpenNESS Getting Started Guide for Network Edge](getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md).
2. Update the `inventory.yaml` file by setting the deployment flavor as `minimal`
    ```yaml
    ---
    all:
      vars:
        cluster_name: minimal_cluster
        flavor: minimal
    ... 
    ```
3. Run CEEK deployment script:
    ```shell
    $ python3 deploy.py
    ```

This deployment flavor enables the following ingredients:
* Node feature discovery
* The default Kubernetes CNI: `calico`
* Telemetry

To customize this flavor we recommend creating additional file in converged-edge-experience-kits that will override any variables used in previous configuration. This file should be placed in location: `converged-edge-experience-kits/inventory/default/group_vars/all` and filenames should start with number greater than highest value currently present (e.g. `40-overrides.yml`).


## CERA Access Edge Flavor

The pre-defined *flexran* deployment flavor provisions an optimized system configuration for vRAN workloads on Intel® Xeon® platforms. It also provisions for deployment of Intel® FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card (Intel® FPGA PAC) N3000 tools and components to enable offloading for the acceleration of FEC (Forward Error Correction) to the FPGA.

The following are steps to install this flavor:
1. Configure the CEEK as described in the [OpenNESS Getting Started Guide for Network Edge](getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md).
2. Configure the flavor file to reflect desired deployment.
   - Configure the CPUs selected for isolation and OS/K8s processes from command line in files [controller_group.yml](https://github.com/otcshare/converged-edge-experience-kits/blob/master/flavors/flexran/controller_group.yml) and [edgenode_group.yml](https://github.com/otcshare/converged-edge-experience-kits/blob/master/flavors/flexran/edgenode_group.yml) - please note that in single node mode the edgenode_group.yml is used to configure the CPU isolation.
   - Configure which CPUs are to be reserved for K8s and OS from K8s level with `reserved_cpu` flag in [all.yml](https://github.com/otcshare/converged-edge-experience-kits/blob/master/flavors/flexran/all.yml) file.
   - Configure whether the FPGA or eASIC support for FEC is desired or both in [all.yml](https://github.com/otcshare/converged-edge-experience-kits/blob/master/flavors/flexran/all.yml) file.

3. Provide necessary files:
   - Create the `ido-converged-edge-experience-kits/ceek/biosfw` directory and copy the `syscfg_package.zip` file to the directory (can be disabled with `ne_biosfw_enable` flag).
   - Create the `ido-converged-edge-experience-kits/ceek/opae_fpga` directory and copy the OPAE_SDK_1.3.7-5_el7.zip to the directory (can be disabled with `ne_opae_fpga_enable` flag)
   - Create the `ido-converged-edge-experience-kits/ceek/nic_drivers` directory and copy the `ice-1.3.2.tar.gz` and `iavf-4.0.2.tar.gz` files to the directory (can be disabled with `e810_driver_enable` flag).

4. Update the `inventory.yaml` file by setting the deployment flavor as `flexran`
    ```yaml
    ---
    all:
      vars:
        cluster_name: flexran_cluster
        flavor: flexran
    ... 
    ```

## CERA Media Analytics Flavor

The pre-defined *media-analytics* deployment flavor provisions an optimized system configuration for media analytics workloads on Intel® Xeon® platforms. It also provisions a set of video analytics services based on the [Video Analytics Serving](https://github.com/intel/video-analytics-serving) for analytics pipeline management and execution.

The following are steps to install this flavor:
1. Configure the CEEK as described in the [OpenNESS Getting Started Guide for Network Edge](getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md).
2. Update the `inventory.yaml` file by setting the deployment flavor as `media-analytics`

    ---
    all:
      vars:
        cluster_name: media_analytics_cluster
        flavor: media-analytics
    ... 
    ```
3. Run CEEK deployment script:
    ```shell
    $ python3 deploy.py
    ```

> **NOTE:** The video analytics services integrates with the OpenNESS service mesh when the flag `ne_istio_enable: true` is set.
> **NOTE:** Kiali management console username can be changed by editing the variable `istio_kiali_username`. By default `istio_kiali_password` is randomly generated and can be retirieved by running `kubectl get secrets/kiali -n istio-system -o json | jq -r '.data.passphrase' | base64 -d` on the Kubernetes controller.
> **NOTE:** Istio deployment can be customized using parameters in the `flavor/media-analytics/all.yaml` (parameters set in the flavor file override default parameters set in `inventory/default/group_vars/all/10-default.yml`).

This deployment flavor enables the following ingredients:
* Node feature discovery
* The default Kubernetes CNI: `calico`
* Video analytics services
* Telemetry
* Istio service mesh - conditional
* Kiali management console - conditional

## CERA Media Analytics Flavor with VCAC-A

2. Add the VCA host name in the `edgenode_vca_group:` group in `inventory.yml` file of the CEEK, e.g:
    ```yaml
    edgenode_vca_group:
      hosts:
        vca-node01.openness.org:
        ansible_host: 172.16.0.1
        ansible_user: openness
    ```
    > **NOTE:** The VCA host name should *only* be placed once in the `inventory.yml` file and under the `edgenode_vca_group:` group. 

3. Update the `inventory.yaml` file by setting the deployment flavor as `media-analytics-vca`
    ```yaml
    ---
    all:
      vars:
        cluster_name: media_analytics_vca_cluster
        flavor: media-analytics-vca
    ... 
    ```

4. Run CEEK deployment script:
    ```shell
    $ python3 deploy.py
    ```

> **NOTE:** At the time of writing this document, *Weave Net*\* is the only supported CNI for network edge deployments involving VCAC-A acceleration. The `weavenet` CNI is automatically selected by the *media-analytics-vca*. 
> **NOTE:** The flag `force_build_enable` (default true) supports force build VCAC-A system image (VCAD) by default, it is defined in flavors/media-analytics-vca/all.yml. By setting the flag as false, CEEK will not rebuild the image and re-use the last system image built during deployment. If the flag is true, CEEK will force build VCA host kernel and node system image which will take several hours.

* Node feature discovery
* VPU and GPU device plugins
* HDDL daemonset
* The `weavenet` Kubernetes CNI
