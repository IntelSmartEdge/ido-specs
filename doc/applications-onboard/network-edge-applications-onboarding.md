# Introduction
The aim of this document is to familiarize the user with the OpenNESS application on-boarding process for the Network Edge. This guide will provide instructions on how to deploy an application from the Edge Controller to Edge Nodes in the cluster; it will provide sample deployment scenarios and traffic configuration for the application. The applications will be deployed from Edge Controller via the Kubernetes `kubectl` command line utility, sample specification files for application onboarding will also be provided.

# Installing OpenNESS
The following application onboarding steps assume that OpenNESS were installed through [OpenNESS playbooks](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md).

# Building Applications
It is the responsibility of the user to provide the application to be deployed on the OpenNESS platform for Network Edge. The application must be provided in a format of Docker image available either from an external Docker repository (ie. Docker Hub) or a locally build/imported Docker image - the image must be available on the Edge Node which the application will be deployed on.

> Note: setting up of the Docker registry is out of scope of this document. If the user already has a docker container image file and would like to copy it to the node manually then `docker load` command can be used to add the image. The success of using such pre-built docker image depends on dependencies of the application that user needs to be aware of. 

The OpenNESS [edgeapps](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps) repository provides images for OpenNESS supported applications. Please pull the repository to your Edge Node in order to build the images.  

This document will explain the build and deployment to two applications 
1. Sample application: Simple hello-world like reference application for OpenNESS 
2. OpenVINO application: A close to real-world inference application 

## Building Sample Application images
The sample application is available in this [location in edgeapps repository](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps/tree/master/sample-app), further information about the application is contained within `Readme.md` file.

To build the sample application Docker images for testing OpenNESS EAA with the consumer and producer applications the following steps are required:

1. To build the application binaries and Docker images run:
   ```
   make
   make build-docker
   ```
2. Check that the images built successfully and are available in local Docker image registry:
   ```
   docker images | grep producer
   docker images | grep consumer
   ```
## Building the OpenVINO Application images
The OpenVINO application is available in this [location in EdgeApps repository](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps/tree/master/openvino), further information about the application is contained within `Readme.md` file.

To build sample application Docker images for testing OpenVINO consumer and producer applications the following steps are required:

1. To build the producer application image from the application directory navigate to the `./producer` directory and run:
   ```
   ./build-image.sh
   ```
    **Note**: Only CPU inference support is currently available for OpenVINO application on OpenNESS Network Edge - environmental variable `OPENVINO_ACCL` must be set to `CPU` within Dockerfile available in the directory

2. To build the consumer application image from application directory navigate to the `./consumer` directory and run:
   ```
   ./build-image.sh
   ```
3. Check that the images built successfully and are available in local Docker image registry:
   ```
   docker images | grep openvino-prod-app
   docker images | grep openvino-cons-app
   ```

Additionally, an application to generate sample traffic is provided. The application should be built on separate host which will generate the traffic.

1. To build the client simulator application image from application directory navigate to the `./clientsim` directory and run: 
   ```
   ./build-image.sh
   ```
2. Check that the image built successfully and is available in local Docker image registry:
   ```
   docker images | grep client-sim
   ```

# Onboarding Sample Application
The purpose of this section is to guide the user on the complete process of onboarding Sample Application, testing the EAA functionality of OpenNESS for the Network Edge. This process will outline how to start the application, setup network policies and verify the functionality.

## Prerequisites

* OpenNESS for Network Edge is fully installed and set up.
* Docker images for the Sample Application consumer and producer are available on Edge Node.

## Verifying image availability

To verify that the images for Sample Application consumer and producer are [built](#building-sample-application-images) and available on the Edge Node run:
   ```
   docker image list | grep producer
   docker image list | grep consumer
   ```

## Applying Kubernetes Network Policies
Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is a mechanism that enables control over how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. By default, in the Network Edge environment, all ingress traffic is blocked (services running inside of deployed applications are not reachable) and all egress traffic is enabled (pods are able to reach the internet).

1. To apply a network policy for the Sample Application allowing ingress traffic create following `sample_policy.yml` file specifying the Network policy:
   ```yml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:  
     name: eaa-prod-cons-policy
     namespace: default
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:  
     - Ingress
     ingress:
     - from:  
       - ipBlock:
           cidr: 10.16.0.0/16  
       ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 80
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 443
   ```
2. Apply the Network Policy:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f sample_policy.yml
   ```

## Deploying Consumer and Producer Sample Application

NOTE: Producer application must be deployed before the consumer application. The applications must be deployed within short time of each other as they have a limited lifespan.

1. To deploy a sample Producer application create the following `sample_producer.yml` pod specification file.
   ```yml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: producer
   spec:  
     replicas: 1
     selector:  
       matchLabels:  
         app: producer  
     template:  
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: producer
       spec:
         tolerations:
         - key: node-role.kube-ovn/master
           effect: NoSchedule
         containers:
         - name: producer
           image: producer:1.0
           imagePullPolicy: Never
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
           - containerPort: 443
   ```
2. Deploy the pod:
   ```
   kubectl create -f sample_producer.yml
   ```
3. Check that the pod is running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods | grep producer
   ```
4. Verify logs of the Sample Application producer:
   ```
   kubectl logs <producer_pod_name> -f

   Expected output:
   The Example Producer eaa.openness  [{ExampleNotification 1.0.0 Description for Event #1 by Example Producer}]}]}
   Sending notification
   ```
5. Verify logs of EAA
   ```
   kubectl logs <eaa_pod_name> -f -n openness 

   Expected output:
   RequestCredentials  request from CN: ExampleNamespace:ExampleProducerAppID, from IP: <IP_ADDRESS> properly handled
   ```
6. To deploy a sample Consumer application create the following `sample_consumer.yml` pod specification file.
   ```yml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: consumer
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: consumer
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: consumer
       spec:
         tolerations:
         - key: node-role.kube-ovn/master  
           effect: NoSchedule
         containers:
         - name: consumer
           image: consumer:1.0
           imagePullPolicy: Never
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
           - containerPort: 443
   ```
7. Deploy the pod:
   ```
   kubectl create -f sample_consumer.yml
   ```
8. Check that the pod is running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods | grep consumer
   ```
9. Verify logs of the Sample Application consumer:
   ```
   kubectl logs <consumer_pod_name> -f

   Expected output:
   Received notification
   ```
10. Verify logs of EAA
    ```
    kubectl logs <eaa_pod_name> -f

    Expected output:
    RequestCredentials  request from CN: ExampleNamespace:ExampleConsumerAppID, from IP: <IP_ADDRESS> properly handled
    ```
# Onboarding OpenVINO application
The purpose of this section is to guide the user on the complete process of onboarding the OpenVINO producer and consumer applications. This process will also guide the user on setting up network connection between Client Simulator (Traffic Generator), setting up network policies and testing the application. The following sub-sections should be executed step by step.

## Prerequisites

* OpenNESS for Network Edge is fully installed and set up.
* The Docker images for the OpenVINO are available on the Edge Node.
* A separate host used for generating traffic via Client Simulator is set up.
* The Edge Node host and traffic generating host are connected together point to point via unused physical network interfaces.
* The Docker image for Client Simulator application is available on the traffic generating host.

## Setting up Networking Interfaces

1. On the traffic generating host set up to run Client Simulator, configure the network interface connected to Edge Node host. External client traffic in OpenNESS Network Edge configuration is routed via 192.168.1.1, the IP address of traffic generating host must be one from same sub-net. Configure the routing accordingly:
   ```
   ip a a 192.168.1.10/24 dev <client_interface_name>
   route add -net 10.16.0.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev <client_interface_name>
   ```

   > **NOTE:** The subnet `192.168.1.0/24` is allocated by Ansible playbook to the physical interface which is attached to the first edge node. The second edge node joined to the cluster is allocated the next subnet `192.168.2.0/24` and so on.

   > **NOTE:** To identify which subnet is allocated to which node, use this command:
   >  ```shell
   >  $ kubectl get subnets
   >  NAME             PROTOCOL   CIDR             PRIVATE   NAT     DEFAULT   GATEWAYTYPE   USED   AVAILABLE
   >  jfsdm001-local   IPv4       192.168.1.0/24   false     false   false     distributed   0      255
   >  jfsdm002-local   IPv4       192.168.2.0/24   false     false   false     distributed   0      255
   >  ...
   >  ```
   >
   > The list presents which subnet (CIDR) is bridged to which edgenode, e.g: node `jfsdm001` is bridged to subnet `192.168.1.0/24` and node `jfsdm002` is bridged to subnet `192.168.2.0/24`

   > **NOTE:** Ingress traffic originating from `192.168.1.0/24` can *only* reach the pods deployed on `jfsdm001`, and similarly for `192.168.2.0/24` can reach the pods deployed on `jfsdm002`.

2. From the Edge Controller, set up the interface service to connect the Edge Node's physical interface used for the communication between Edge Node and traffic generating host to OVS. This allows the Client Simulator to communicate with the OpenVINO application K8s Pod located on the Edge Node (sample output separated by `"..."`, PCI Bus Function ID of the interface used my vary).
   ```
   kubectl interfaceservice get <edge_node_host_name>
   ...
   0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  detached
   ...
    
   kubectl interfaceservice attach <edge_node_host_name> 0000:86:00.0
   ...
   Interface: 0000:86:00.0 successfully attached
   ...

   kubectl interfaceservice get <edge_node_host_name>
   ...
   0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  attached
   ...
   ```

## Deploying the Application

1. An application `yaml` specification file for the OpenVINO producer used to deploy the K8s pod can be found in the Edge Apps repository at [./applications/openvino/producer/openvino-prod-app.yaml](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps/blob/master/applications/openvino/producer/openvino-prod-app.yaml). The pod will use the Docker image which must be [built](#building-openvino-application-images) and available on the platform. Deploy the producer application by running:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f openvino-prod-app.yaml
   ```
2. An application `yaml` specification file for the OpenVINO consumer used to deploy K8s pod can be found in the Edge Apps repository at [./applications/openvino/consumer/openvino-cons-app.yaml](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps/blob/master/applications/openvino/consumer/openvino-cons-app.yaml). The pod will use the Docker image which must be [built](#building-openvino-application-images) and available on the platform. Deploy consumer application by running:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f openvino-cons-app.yaml
   ```
3. Verify that no errors show up in logs of OpenVINO consumer application:
   ```
   kubectl logs openvino-cons-app
   ```
4. Log into the consumer application pod and modify `analytics.openness` entry in `/etc/hosts` with IP address set in step one of [Setting up Networking Interfaces](#Setting-up-Networking-Interfaces) (192.168.1.10 by default, the physical interface connected to traffic generating host).
   ```
   kubectl exec -it openvino-cons-app /bin/sh
   apt-get install vim
   vim /etc/hosts
   ```

## Applying Kubernetes Network Policies
Kubernetes NetworkPolicy is a mechanism that enables control over how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.

By default, in a Network Edge environment, all ingress traffic is blocked (services running inside of deployed applications are not reachable) and all egress traffic is enabled (pods are able to reach the internet). The following NetworkPolicy definition is used:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: block-all-ingress
     namespace: default        # selects default namespace
   spec:
     podSelector: {}           # matches all the pods in the default namespace
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     ingress: []               # no rules allowing ingress traffic = ingress blocked
   ```

`Note: When adding the first egress rule, all egress is blocked except for that rule.`

1. To deploy a Network Policy allowing ingress traffic on port 5000 (tcp and udp) from 192.168.1.0/24 network to OpenVINO consumer application pod, create the following specification file for this Network Policy:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: openvino-policy
     namespace: default
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         name: openvino-cons-app
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     ingress:
     - from:
       - ipBlock:
           cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
       ports:
       - protocol: TCP
         port: 5000
       - protocol: UDP
         port: 5000
   ```
2. Create the Network Policy:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f network_policy.yml
   ```

## Setting up Edge DNS
Edge DNS enables the user to resolve addresses of Edge Applications using domain names.
The following is an example of how to set up DNS resolution for OpenVINO consumer application.

1. Find Edge DNS pod:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -n openness | grep edgedns
   ```
2. Get IP address of the Edge DNS pod and take note of it (this will be used to [allow remote host](#Starting-traffic-from-Client-Simulator) to access Edge DNS):
   ```
   kubectl exec -it <edgedns-pod-name> -n openness ip a
   ```
3. Create a file openvino-dns.json specifying the Edge DNS entry for the OpenVINO consumer application (where `10.16.0.10` is the IP address of OpenVINO consumer application - change accordingly):
   ```yaml
   {
     "record_type":"A",
     "fqdn":"openvino.openness",
     "addresses":["10.16.0.10"]
   }
   ```
4. Apply the Edge DNS entry for the application:
   ```
   kubectl edgedns set <edge_node_host_name> openvino-dns.json
   ```

## Starting traffic from Client Simulator

1. Configure nameserver to allow connection to Edge DNS (make sure that openvino.openness is not defined in `/etc/hosts`). Modify `/etc/resolv.conf` and add IP address of [Edge DNS server](#Setting-up-Edge-DNS).
   ```
   vim /etc/resolv.conf

   Add to the file:
   nameserver <edge_dns_ip_address>
   ```
2. Verify that `openvino.openness` is correctly resolved (`ANSWER` section should contain IP of Edge DNS).
   ```
   dig openvino.openness
   ```
3. On the traffic generating host build the image for the [Client Simulator](#building-openvino-application-images)
4. Run the following from [edgeapps/applications/openvino/clientsim](https://github.com/otcshare/edgeapps/blob/master/applications/openvino/clientsim/run-docker.sh) to start the video traffic via the containerized Client Simulator. Graphical user environment is required to observed the results of the returning augmented videos stream.
   ```
   ./run_docker.sh
   ```

> **NOTE:** If a problem is encountered when running the `client-sim ` docker as `Could not initialize SDL - No available video device`. Disable SELinux through this command:
>  ```shell
>  $ setenforce 0
>  ```

> **NOTE:**  If the video window is not popping up and/or an error like `Could not find codec parameters for stream 0` appears, 1) check whether receive traffic on port `5001` via tcpdump 2) add a rule in firewall to permit ingress traffic on port `5001` if observe `host administratively prohibited`:
>  ```shell
>  firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -p udp --dport 5001 -j ACCEPT
>  firewall-cmd --reload
>  ```
> or directly shutdown firewall as
>  ```shell
>  systemctl stop firewalld.service
>  ```


# Onboarding Smart City Sample Application

The Smart City sample application is built on the OpenVINO and Open Visual Cloud (OVC) software stacks for media processing and analytics. It simulates regional offices which aggregate multiple (simulated) IP cameras and associated analytics. Each simulated office is deployed on an edge node. The sample app demonstrates the ability to reduce latency by running the media processing and analytics workloads on edge nodes.

The full pipeline of the Smart City sample application on OpenNESS is distributed across three regions:

 1. Client-side Cameras Simulator(s)
 2. OpenNESS Cluster
 3. Smart City Cloud Cluster

The Smart City setup with OpenNESS should typically deployed as shown in this Figure. The drawing depicts 2 offices for the purpose of this guide, but there is no limitation to the number of offices.

![Smart City Setup](network-edge-app-onboarding-images/ovc-smartcity-setup.png)

_Figure - Smart City Setup with OpenNESS_


## Setting up Networking Interfaces

> **NOTE**: At the time of writing this guide, there was no [Network Policy for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) defined yet for the Smart City application. So, it is advised to remove the default OpenNESS network policies using this command:
> ```shell
> kubectl delete netpol block-all-ingress cdi-upload-proxy-policy
> ```

From the OpenNESS Controller, attach the physical ethernet interface to be used for dataplane traffic using the `interfaceservice` kubectl plugin by providing the office hostname and the PCI Function ID corresponding to the ethernet interface (the PCI ID below is just a sample and may vary on other setups):
```shell
kubectl interfaceservice get <officeX_host_name>
...
0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  detached
...

kubectl interfaceservice attach <officeX_host_name> 0000:86:00.0
...
Interface: 0000:86:00.0 successfully attached
...

kubectl interfaceservice get <officeX_host_name>
...
0000:86:00.0  |  3c:fd:fe:b2:42:d0  |  attached
...
```

> **NOTE:** When adding office 2 and so on, attach their corresponding physical interfaces accordingly.

## Building Smart City ingredients

   1. Clone the Smart City Reference Pipeline source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Smart-City-Sample.git) to: (1) Camera simulator machines, (2) OpenNESS Controller machine, and (3) Smart City cloud master machine.

   2. Build the Smart City application on all of the machines as explained in [Smart City deployment on OpenNESS](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/Smart-City-Sample/tree/openness-k8s/deployment/openness). At least 2 offices (edge nodes) must be installed on OpenNESS.

## Running Smart City

   1. On the Camera simulator machines, assign IP address to the ethernet interface which the dataplane traffic will be transmitted through to the edge office1 & office2 nodes:
   
      On camera-sim1:
      ```shell
      ip a a 192.168.1.10/24 dev <office1_interface_name>
      route add -net 10.16.0.0/24 gw 192.168.1.1 dev <office1_interface_name>
      ```

      > **NOTE:** When adding office 2 and so on, change the CIDR (i.e: `192.168.1.0/24`) to corresponding subnet. Allocated subnets to individual offices can be retrieved by entering this command in the OpenNESS controller shell:
      > ```shell
      > kubectl get subnets
      > ```
      >
      > The subnet name represents the node which is allocated to it and appended with `-local`.


      On camera-sim2:
      ```shell
      ip a a 192.168.2.10/24 dev <office2_interface_name>
      route add -net 10.16.0.0/24 gw 192.168.2.1 dev <office2_interface_name>
      ```

   2. On the Camera simulator machines, run the camera simulator containers
      ```shell
      make start_openness_camera
      ```

   3. On the Smart City cloud master machine, run the Smart City cloud containers
       ```shell
       make start_openness_cloud
       ```

       > **NOTE**: At the time of writing this guide, there was no firewall rules defined for the camera simulators & Smart City cloud containers. If none is defined, firewall must be stopped or disabled before continuing. All communication back to the office nodes will be blocked. Run the below on both machines.
       > ```shell
       > systemctl stop firewalld
       > ```

       > **NOTE**: Do not stop firewall on OpenNESS nodes.

   4. On the OpenNESS Controller machine, build & run the Smart City cloud containers
       ```shell
       export CAMERA_HOSTS=192.168.1.10,192.168.2.10
       export CLOUD_HOST=<cloud-master-node-ip>

       make
       make update
       make start_openness_office
      ```

       > **NOTE**: `<cloud-master-node-ip>` is where the Smart City cloud master machine can be reached on the management/cloud network.

   5. From the web browser, launch the Smart City web UI at URL `https://<cloud-master-node-ip>/`

## Inter Application Communication 
The IAC is available via the default overlay network used by Kubernetes - Kube-OVN.
For more information on Kube-OVN refer to the Kube-OVN support in OpenNESS [documentation](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/dataplane/openness-interapp.md#interapp-communication-support-in-openness-network-edge)

# Enhanced Platform Awareness
Enhanced platform awareness is supported in OpenNESS via the use of the Kubernetes NFD plugin. This plugin is enabled in OpenNESS for Network Edge by default please refer to the [NFD whitepaper](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/enhanced-platform-awareness/openness-node-feature-discovery.md) for information on how to make your application pods aware of the supported platform capabilities.

Refer to [<b>supported-epa.md</b>](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/network-edge/supported-epa.md) for the list of supported EPA features on OpenNESS network edge.

# VM support for Network Edge
Support for VM deployment on OpenNESS for Network Edge is available and enabled by default, certain configuration and pre-requisites may need to be fulfilled in order to use all capabilities.
