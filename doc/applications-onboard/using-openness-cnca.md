# 4G/LTE Core Configuration using CNCA

## Configuring in Network Edge mode

For Network Edge mode, CNCA provides a kubectl plugin to configure the 4G/LTE Core network. Kubernetes\* adopts plugins concepts to extend its functionality. The `kube-cnca` plugin executes CNCA related functions within the Kubernetes eco-system. The plugin performs remote callouts against LTE Control and User Plane Separation (LTE CUPS) Operation Administration and Maintenance (OAM) agent.

Available management with `kube-cnca` against LTE CUPS OAM agent are:

1. Creation of LTE CUPS userplanes
2. Deletion of LTE CUPS userplanes
3. Updating (patching) LTE CUPS userplanes

The `kube-cnca` plugin is installed automatically on the control plane during the installation phase of the [OpenNESS Experience Kit](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/openness-experience-kits.md).
In the following sections, a detailed explanation with examples is provided about the CNCA management.

Creation of the LTE CUPS userplane is performed based on the configuration provided by the given YAML file. The YAML configuration should follow the provided sample YAML in [Sample YAML LTE CUPS userplane configuration](#sample-yaml-lte-cups-userplane-configuration) section. Use the `apply` command to post a userplane creation request onto Application Function (AF):

```shell
kubectl cnca apply -f <config.yml>
```

When the userplane is created successfully, the `apply` command returns the userplane identifier `<userplane-id>`, which should be used in further correspondence with LTE CUPS OAM agent concerning this particular userplane. It is the responsibility of the user to retain the `<userplane-id>` as `kube-cnca` is a stateless function.

>**NOTE**: All active userplanes can be retrieved from AF through the command `kubectl cnca get userplanes`.

To retrieve an existing userplane with a known userplane ID, use the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnca get userplane <userplane-id>
```

To retrieve all active userplanes at LTE CUPS OAM agent, use the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnca get userplanes
```

To modify an active userplane, use the `patch` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca patch <userplane-id> -f <config.yml>
```

To delete an active userplane, use the `delete` command:

```shell
kubectl cnca delete userplane <userplane-id>
```

### Sample YAML LTE CUPS userplane configuration

Similarly, the `kube-cnca` expects the YAML configuration for the LTE CUPS-specific information as shown in the following format. The file must contain the topmost configurations: `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `policy`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: lte
policy:
  id: '5'
  uuid: beauty
  function: SAEGWU
  config:
    s5u_pgw:
      up_ip_address: 192.168.120.122
    s1u:
      up_ip_address: 192.190.120.122
    s5u_sgw:
      up_ip_address: 192.168.120.122
  selectors:
  - id: select001
    network:
      mcc: '466'
      mnc: '92'
    uli:
      tai:
        tac: 51
    pdn:
      apns:
      - APN001
```

# 5G NGC components bring up and Configuration using CNCA

OpenNESS provides Ansible\* scripts for setting up NGC components for two scenarios. Each of the scenarios is supported by a separate role in the OpenNESS Experience Kit:

Role "ngc"
This role brings up the 5g OpenNESS setup in the loopback mode for testing and demonstrating its usability. The Ansible scripts that are part of the "ngc" role build, configure, and start AF, Network Exposure Function (NEF), OAM, and Core Network Test Function (CNTF) in the Network Edge mode. Within this role, AF and OAM are set up on the controller node. NEF and CNTF are set up on the edge node.  The description of the configuration and setup of the NGC components provided in the next sections of this document refers to the ngc role. The NGC components set up within the ngc role can be fully integrated and tested with the provided kubectl plugin or CNCA UI.

## Network Edge mode

### Bring up of NGC components in Network Edge mode

- If OpenNESS (Edge Controller + Edge Node) is not yet deployed through openness-experience-kit, then:
  Enable the role for ngc by changing the `ne_ngc_enable` variable to `true` in `group_vars/all/20-enhanced.yml` before running `deploy_ne.sh -f <flavor>` or `deploy_ne.sh -f <flavor> single`, as described in the [OpenNESS Network Edge: Controller and Edge node setup](../getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md) document. If not, skip this step.

- If OpenNESS Edge Controller + Edge Node is already deployed (but without enabling the ngc role) and at a later stage you want to enable NGC components then:
  Enable the role for ngc by changing the `ne_ngc_enable` variable to `true` in `group_vars/all/20-enhanced.yml` and then re-run `deploy_ne.sh -f <flavor>` or `deploy_ne.sh -f <flavor> single` as described in the [OpenNESS Network Edge: Controller and Edge node setup](../getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md) document.

  >**NOTE**: In addition to the OpenNESS controller bring up, by enabling the ngc role, the playbook scripts performs:

  - A clone of the x-epcforedge repo from GitHub\*
  - Builds AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF microservices
  - Generates certificate files at the location **/opt/openness/certs/ngc** on the controller.
  - Creates ConfigMap **certs-cm** from the above directory.
  - Updates the configuration files of AF and NEF with the service names of NEF and CNTF respectively.
  - Copies the OAM, NEF, CNTF and AF configuration to the location **/opt/openness/configs/ngc** on the controller.
  - Creates ConfigMap **oauth2-cm** from the **/opt/openness/configs/ngc/oauth2.json** configuration file.
  - Creates template of ConfigMaps **af-cm**,**nef-cm**,**cntf-cm**,**oam-cm** from the respective configuration json files present in the **/opt/openness/configs/ngc** directory.
  - Copies these templates to the respective template folders of the helm charts for AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF.
  - Creates docker images for AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF microservices and adds them into the Docker\* registry at **\<controller ip:port\>**.
  - Installs the helm charts for AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF using the images from the Docker registry
  - Copies the helm charts for AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF into the location **/opt/openness/helm-charts/**

- On successful AF, NEF, OAM, and CNTF PODs should start. Status of PODs, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Services, images, and helm charts can be verified using the following commands:

    ```shell
   - kubectl get pods -n ngc

    ```

#### Deploying the Network Edge Mode to work with 5G Core Network

The OpenNESS ngc role deploys the PODS as described below:

- AF and OAM PODs on the controller
- NEF and CNTF PODs on the node, where CNTF is a simulation of the core network functions used by NEF and AF.

If the AF configuration needs to be updated (as per your deployment configuration) to use the NEF from the 5G Core Network then complete the following steps:

1. Delete the NEF and CNTF PODs using helm:

    ```shell
    helm uninstall nef
    release "nef" uninstalled

    helm uninstall cntf
    release "cntf" uninstalled
    ```

2. Update the AF POD using helm:

     - Open the AF configmap template file `/opt/openness/helm-charts/af/templates/configmapAF.yaml` and modify the parameters.
     - Save and exit.
     - Now update the AF POD using the following command:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade af /opt/openness/helm-charts/af --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/af-image
    Release "af" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
    NAME: af
    LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jul 24 12:29:44 2020
    NAMESPACE: default
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 2
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    Chart af was successfully installed

    af image was saved in the docker registry
    Image name: <controller-ip>:5000/af-image:1.0

    Your release is named af.

    To learn more about the release, try:

      $ helm status af
      $ helm get all af


    kubectl get pods -n ngc
    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    af-7695ccb494-7v4zx    1/1     Running   0          2m39s
    oam-659b5db5b5-cf7ds   1/1     Running   0          3d18h

    ```

    - A successful restart of AF with the updated config can be observed through AF container logs. Run the following command to get AF logs:
    `kubectl logs -f af-7695ccb494-7v4zx --namespace=ngc`
    Sample output of the AF container logs with the updated config may appear as:
  ![NGC list of PODS](using-openness-cnca-images/ngc_af_service_config_log.png)

If the NEF configuration needs to be updated (as per your deployment configuration) to use the SMF/PCF/UDR from the 5G Core Network instead of CNTF, then complete the following steps:

1. Delete the CNTF PODs using helm:

    ```shell
    helm uninstall cntf
    release "cntf" uninstalled
    ```

2. Update the NEF POD using helm:

     - Open the NEF configmap template file `/opt/openness/helm-charts/nef/templates/configmapNEF.yaml` and modify the parameters.
     - Save and exit.
     - Now update the NEF POD using the following command:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade  nef /opt/openness/helm-charts/nef --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/nef-image
    Release "nef" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
    NAME: nef
    LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jul 24 12:37:20 2020
    NAMESPACE: default
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 2
    TEST SUITE: None
    NOTES:
    Chart nef was successfully installed

    nef image was saved in the docker registry
    Image name: <controller-ip>:5000/nef-image:1.0

    Your release is named nef.

    To learn more about the release, try:

      $ helm status nef
      $ helm get all nef


    kubectl get pods -n ngc
    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    af-7695ccb494-7v4zx    1/1     Running   0          8m29s
    nef-77d67c6778-ph5t4   1/1     Running   0          45s
    oam-659b5db5b5-cf7ds   1/1     Running   0          3d18h

    ```

Modifying the OAM configuration. Follow the same steps as above (as done for AF) with the following differences:

- Open the file `/opt/openness/helm-charts/oam/templates/configmapOAM.yaml` and modify the parameters.
- Save and exit.
- Now restart the OAM POD using the command:

```shell
helm upgrade  oam /opt/openness/helm-charts/oam --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/oam-image
```

- A successful restart of the OAM with the updated config can be observed through OAM container logs. Run the following command to get OAM logs:
`kubectl logs -f oam-659b5db5b5-l26q8 --namespace=ngc`

Modifying the oauth2 configuration. Complete the following steps:

- Open the file `/opt/openness/configs/ngc/oauth2.json` and modify the parameters.
- Save and exit.

1. Delete the CNTF, AF, and NEF PODs using helm:

    ```shell
    helm uninstall cntf
    release "cntf" uninstalled
    helm uninstall nef
    release "nef" uninstalled
    helm uninstall cntf
    release "af" uninstalled
    ```

2. Update the ConfigMap associated with oauth2.json:

    ```shell
    kubectl create configmap oauth2-cm --from-file /opt/openness/configs/ngc/oauth2.json -n ngc -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl replace -f -
    ```

3. Restart NEF, CNTF, and AF PODs using the following commands:

    ```shell
    helm install  nef /opt/openness/helm-charts/nef --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/nef-image
    helm install  af /opt/openness/helm-charts/af --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/af-image
    helm install  cntf /opt/openness/helm-charts/cntf --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/cntf-image
    ```

Modifying the certificates. Complete the following steps:

- Update the certificates present in the directory `/opt/openness/certs/ngc/`.

1. Delete the CNTF, AF, NEF, and OAM PODs using helm:

    ```shell
    helm uninstall cntf
    release "cntf" uninstalled
    helm uninstall nef
    release "nef" uninstalled
    helm uninstall cntf
    release "af" uninstalled
    helm uninstall oam
    release "oam" uninstalled
    ```

2. Update the ConfigMap associated with the certificates directory:

    ```shell
    kubectl create configmap certs-cm --from-file /opt/openness/certs/ngc/ -n ngc -o yaml --dry-run=client | kubectl replace -f -
    ```

3. Check certs-cm present in available ConfigMaps list:

    ```shell
    kubectl get cm -n ngc
    ```  

4. Restart NEF, CNTF, AF, and OAM PODs using the following commands:

    ```shell
    helm install  nef /opt/openness/helm-charts/nef --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/nef-image
    helm install  af /opt/openness/helm-charts/af --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/af-image
    helm install  cntf /opt/openness/helm-charts/cntf --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/cntf-image
    helm install  oam /opt/openness/helm-charts/oam --set image.repository=<controller-ip>:5000/oam-image
    ```

### Configuring in Network Edge mode

For Network Edge mode, the CNCA provides a kubectl plugin to configure the 5G Core network. Kubernetes adopted plugin concepts to extend its functionality. The `kube-cnca` plugin executes CNCA related functions within the Kubernetes ecosystem. The plugin performs remote callouts against NGC OAM and AF microservice on the controller itself.

The `kube-cnca` plugin is installed automatically on the control plane node during the installation phase of the [OpenNESS Experience Kit](https://github.com/otcshare/x-specs/blob/master/doc/getting-started/network-edge/controller-edge-node-setup.md)

#### Edge Node services operations with 5G Core (through OAM interface)

>**NOTE**: Registration of the OpenNESS Controller's AF instance with the 5G core must be performed manually (or through any other interface) exposed by the 5G Core.  OAM capabilities will be enhanced in future releases to support this. The current version of OAM supports only one instance of the OpenNESS Controller to communicate.

##### Registration of UPF services associated with Edge-node with 5G Core

Supported operations through `kube-cnca` plugin:

- Registration of edge service info for UPF with a 5G Core through OAM interface (co-located with Edge-Node)
- Un-registration of edge service info

To register the AF service through the NGC OAM function, run:

```shell
kubectl cnca register --dnai=<DNAI> --dnn=<DNN> --tac=<TAC> --priDns=<pri-DNS> --secDns=<sec-DNS> --upfIp=<UPF-IP> --snssai=<SNSSAI>
```

The following parameters MUST be provided to the command:

1. Data Network Access Identifier (DNAI)
2. Data Network Name (DNN)
3. Primary DNS (priDns)
4. Secondary DNS (secDns)
5. UPF IP Address (upfIp)
6. Network Slice Identifier (SNSSAI)

Upon successful registration, subscriptions can be instantiated over the NGC AF. The `af-service-id` is returned by the `register` command to be used in further correspondence with NGC OAM and AF functions.

Un-registration of the AF service can be performed with the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnca unregister <af-service-id>

#### Traffic influence operations with 5G Core (through AF interface)

Supported operations through `kube-cnca` plugin:

- Creation of traffic influence subscriptions through the AF microservice to steer application traffic towards edge-node
- Deletion of subscriptions
- Updating (patching) subscriptions
- get or get-all subscriptions

Creation of the AF subscription is performed based on the configuration provided by the given YAML file. The YAML configuration should follow the provided sample YAML in the [Sample YAML NGC AF subscription configuration](#sample-yaml-ngc-af-subscription-configuration) section. Use the `apply` command to post a subscription creation request onto AF:

```shell
kubectl cnca apply -f <config.yml>
```

When the subscription is successfully created, the `apply` command will return the subscription URL that includes a subscription identifier at the end of the string. Only this subscription identifier `<subscription-id>` should be used in further correspondence with AF concerning this particular subscription. For example, <https://localhost:8060/3gpp-traffic-influence/v1/1/subscriptions/11111>  and subscription-id is 11111. It is the responsibility of the user to retain the `<subscription-id>` as `kube-cnca` is a stateless function.

To retrieve an existing subscription with a known subscription ID, use the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnca get subscription <subscription-id>
```

To retrieve all active subscriptions at AF, execute this command:

```shell
kubectl cnca get subscriptions
```

To modify an active subscription, use the `patch` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca patch <subscription-id> -f <config.yml>
```

To delete an active subscription, use the `delete` command:

```shell
kubectl cnca delete subscription <subscription-id>
```

##### Sample YAML NGC AF subscription configuration

The `kube-cnca` expects the YAML configuration as in the format below. The file must contain the topmost configurations: `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `policy`. The configuration `policy` retains the NGC AF-specific subscription information.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ngc
policy:
  afServiceId: 'afService001'
  afAppId: 'afApp01'
  afTransId: 'afTrans01'
  appReloInd: false
  dnn: 'edgeLocation001'
  snssai:
    sst: 0
    sd: 'default'
  gpsi: ''
  ipv4Addr: '127.0.0.1'
  ipv6Addr: ''
  macAddr: ''
  requestTestNotification: true
  trafficRoutes:
  - dnai: 'edgeLocation001'
    routeInfo:
      ipv4Addr: ''
      ipv6Addr: ''
    routeProfId: 'default'
```

#### Packet Flow Description operations with 5G Core (through AF interface)

Supported operations through the `kube-cnca` plugin:

- Creation of packet flow description (PFD) transactions through the AF microservice to perform accurate detection of application traffic for UPF in 5G Core
- Deletion of transactions and applications within a transaction
- Updating (patching) transactions and applications within a transaction
- Get or get all transactions.
- Get a specific application within a transaction

Creation of the AF PFD transaction is performed based on the configuration provided by the given YAML file. The YAML configuration should follow the provided sample YAML in the [Sample YAML NGC AF transaction configuration](#sample-yaml-ngc-af-transaction-configuration) section. Use the `apply` command as below to post a PFD transaction creation request onto AF:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd apply -f <config.yml>
```

When the PFD transaction is successfully created, the `apply` command will return the transaction URL, which includes a transaction identifier at the end of the string. Only this transaction identifier `<transaction-id>` should be used in further correspondence with AF concerning this particular transaction. For example, <https://localhost:8050/af/v1/pfd/transactions/10000>  and transaction-id is 10000. It is the responsibility of the user to retain the `<transaction-id>` as `kube-cnca` is a stateless function.

To retrieve an existing PFD transaction with a known transaction ID, use the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd get transaction <transaction-id>
```

To retrieve all active PFD transactions at AF, run:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd get transactions
```

To modify an active PFD transaction, use the `patch` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd patch transaction <transaction-id> -f <config.yml>
```

To delete an active PFD transaction, use the `delete` command:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd delete transaction <transaction-id>
```

To retrieve an existing application within a PFD  transaction with a known application ID and transaction ID, use:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd get transaction <transaction-id> application <application-id>
```

To modify an application within an active PFD transaction, use the `patch` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd patch transaction <transaction-id> application <application-id> -f <config.yml>
```

To delete an application within an active PFD transaction, use the `delete` command:

```shell
kubectl cnca pfd delete transaction <transaction-id> application <application-id>
```

##### Sample YAML NGC AF PFD transaction configuration

The `kube-cnca pfd apply` expects the YAML configuration as in the format below. The file must contain the topmost configurations: `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `policy`. The configuration `policy` retains the NGC AF-specific transaction information.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ngc_pfd
policy:
  pfdDatas:
    - externalAppID: afApp01
      allowedDelay: 1000
      cachingTime: 1000
      pfds:
        - pfdID: pfdId01
          flowDescriptions:
            - "permit in ip from 10.11.12.123 80 to any"
          domainNames:
            - "www.google.com"
        - pfdID: pfdId02
          urls:
            - "^http://test.example2.net(/\\S*)?$"
        - pfdID: pfdId03
          domainNames:

          flowDescriptions:
            - "permit in ip from 10.68.28.39 80 to any"
        - pfdID: pfdId04
          urls:
            - "^http://test.example1.net(/\\S*)?$"
        - pfdID: pfdId05
          domainNames:
            - "www.example.com"
```

Sample yaml file for updating a single application:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ngc_pfd
policy:
  externalAppID: afApp01
  allowedDelay: 1000
  cachingTime: 1000
  pfds:
    - pfdID: pfdId01
      flowDescriptions:
        - "permit in ip from 10.11.12.123 80 to any"
    - pfdID: pfdId02
      urls:

    - pfdID: pfdId03
      domainNames:
        - "www.latest_example.com"
```

#### Policy Authorization operations with 5G Core (through AF interface)

Supported operations through `kube-cnca` plugin:

- Creation of Policy Authorization - Application session context through the AF microservice.
- Deletion of application session context.
- Updating (patching) application session context.
- Get application session context.
- Update or delete Event Notification within an application session context.

Creation of the Policy Authorization Application session context is performed based on the configuration provided by the given YAML file. The YAML configuration should follow the provided sample YAML in the [Sample YAML NGC AF transaction configuration](#sample-yaml-ngc-af-policy-authorization-configuration) section. Use the `apply` command as shown below to post an application session context creation request onto AF:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization apply -f <config.yml>
```

When the application session context is successfully created, the `apply` command will return the application session context ID (appSessionId). Only `<appSessionId>` should be used in further correspondence with AF concerning this particular application session context. It is the responsibility of the user to retain the `<appSessionId>` as `kube-cnca` is a stateless function.

To retrieve an existing AppSession Session Context with a known appSessionId, use:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization get <appSessionId>
```

To modify an active Application Session Context, use the `patch` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization patch <appSessionId> -f <config.yml>
```

To delete an active Application Session Context, use the `delete` command as below:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization delete <appSessionId>
```

To add/modify Event Notification of active Application Session Context, use the `subscribe` command and provide a YAML file with the subset of the configuration to be modified:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization subscribe <appSessionId> -f <config.yml>
```

To unsubscribe from Event Notification of active Application Session Context, use the `unsubscribe` command:

```shell
kubectl cnca policy-authorization unsubscribe <appSessionId>
```

##### Sample YAML NGC AF Policy Authorization configuration
