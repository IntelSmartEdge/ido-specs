## Overview

OpenNESS is an open source software toolkit to enable easy orchestration and management of edge services across diverse network platform and access technologies in multi-cloud environments.
OpenNESS can integrate with Baidu Cloud Connector --OpenEdge which is Edge IoT Gateway. 
(Together with Baidu edge management dashboard, the whole Baidu Edge solution is called as Baidu® IntelliEdge. More details refer to Baidu's website: www.baidu.com)

This application note will provide guidelines and examples on:

## Integration Architecture

Figure 1. Integration Architecture for OpenEdge on OpenNESS.

![](baidu-cloudadapter-images//openness_baiduedge_integration_arch.png)

- OpenNESS Edge Platform support Cloud Native Infrastructure. Baidu OpenEdge and other edge apps can run as separated container.
  OpenNESS NTS will send/receive data traffic to/from the apps according to traffic routing configuration.

- OpenEdge can play as two types of Apps
  - Producer: provides a service to other apps on the Edge Platform (need control path between OpenEdge and OpenNESS for EAA interaction).
  - Consumer: consumes end user traffic and optionally can get services from producer apps on the same edge platform. (If need to get services from other edge apps, it need to use control path to authenticate and register with OpenNESS).
  - NOTE: in the application note, OpenEdge is treated as pure consumer application and need not get service from other edge apps. So in the integration architecture diagram, there is not control path.

## Run OpenEdge on OpenNESS 

This section describe how to setup and run OpenEdge as a consumer application on OpenNESS based on cloud native infrastructure.

### OpenNESS Setup

Follow ```OpenNESS user guide``` to prepare setup envionment, deploy OpenNESS and configure traffic routing rules.

### OpenEdge Setup

#### Scripts overview

In the OpenNESS release package, it provides example scripts to help user for the setup. 
The scripts are located in the release package with folder name ```setup_baidu_openedge``` as below structure:

```docker
setup_baidu_openedge
├── 01_setup.sh
├── 02_build.sh
├── 03_deploy.sh
├── composefile
│   ├── democfg
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── entrypoint.sh
├── docker
│   ├── cleanup.yml
│   ├── compose_build.yml
│   └── compose_up.yml
├── mqtt
│   ├── devices
│   │   ├── openedge_pub.py
│   │   └── openedge_sub.py
│   └── rtt
│   ├── measure_rtt_iothub.py
│   └── measure_rtt_openedge.py
├── tasks
│   ├── build_main.yml
│   ├── deploy_main.yml
│   ├── script_success.yml
│   └── setup_main.yml
└── vars
└── defaults.yml
```

There are three main scripts: ```01_setup.sh```, ```02_build.sh``` and ```03_deploy.sh```. The scrips need to be executed as root user in the order
from local console on the OpenNESS server or remotely via SSH. The other scripts will be called by the three main scripts for the setup.

- The folder - ```mqtt``` contains MQTT IOT device simulators for end to end testing, so they should be executed from device machines.
- The folder - ```democfg``` where should put files downloaded from baidu cloud to bringup Openedge. Details refer to below chapter.
- To run the scripts correctly, need make sure that the whole folder ```setup_baidu_openedge``` locates at : ```appliance-ce/scripts/ansible/examples/ ```

#### Prepare OpenEdge certs and configuration files

Before build and run OpenEdge, need to register Baidu account to get certification and configuration files which nesseceray for OpenEdge
gateway to register with Baidu ® IntelliEdge management suite (It provides management dashboard for managing OpenEdge gateway.) More details about how to get those Baidu's files, please goto
<https://cloud.baidu.com/> and serch key word: Baidu IntelliEdge.

In the folder: ```setup_baidu_openedge/composefile/democfg```, put certification and configuration files got from Baidu® IntelliEdge to the folder.
So when building container image for OpenEdge, those files will be copied into the image. The sub-directory structure in the democfg should look like as below:

```docker
├── democfg
│ ├── agent-cert
│ │ ├── client.key
│ │ ├── client.pem
│ │ ├── openapi.pem
│ │ └── root.pem
│ ├── agent-conf
│ │ └── service.yml
│ ├── application.yml
│ └── remote-iothub-conf
│ └── service.yml
```

Below will describe example configuration for your reference, and the example configurations can be used for the end to end example demo in chapter 4.0 End to End Example Demo.

**Democfg/application.yml example:**

```docker

**Democfg/** **agent-cert/ example:**
The cert files should be downloaded from Baidu IntelliEdge management dashboard for the OpenEdge gateway and put into the subfolder: ```/democfg/agent-cert/```.

**Democfg/** **agent-conf/service.yml example:**
The service.yml file should be downloaded from Baidu IntelliEdge management dashboard for the OpenEdge gateway and put into the subfolder: ```/democfg/agent-conf/```.

**Democfg/remote-iothub-conf/service.yml example:**

```docker
 hub:
 address: tcp://0.0.0.0:1883

```

The configuration file is used for testing the IoT data route from Baidu OpenEdge to IoTHub Cloud (also named as IoTHub). 
To get more information about Baidu IotHub Cloud, goto website: cloud.baidu.com, and search keyword: iothub.

#### Running scripts -- build and run OpenEdge

On the server that is running OpenNESS, executed the scripts as blew:
```docker
01_setup.sh
02_build.sh
03_deploy.sh
```

After competition for each script, expected successful print should be as:

```docker
"msg": "Script completed successfully"
```

Check docker information to make sure that the container STATUS is Up.

```docker
#docker ps

## End to End Example Demo

### Overview

Figure 2. End to End Example Diagram.

![](baidu-cloudadapter-images//openness_baiduedge_end2end_demosetup.png)

This is an end to end example demo for MQTT traffic. This could be an IOT industrial application. 
It consists of the following elements and related IOT data processing:

- Two MQTT devices as publisher and subscriber. Can use MQTT client software to simulate two MQTT IOT devices.

- OpenNESS Controller: OpenNESS controller performs management and policy configuration. 
  For this example, controller will configure traffic rule for routing MQTT IOT traffic to Baidu OpenEdge via OpenNESS.

- Baidu OpenEdge: In the example provided as part of OpenNESS Baidu OpenEdge app is deployed as a pure consumer app without consuming any services from other producer application on the edge node. Hence the Baidu OpenEdge app need not call EAA APIs. The app will handle data traffic from/to MQTT devices via OpenNESS dataplane.
> Note: Implementing EAA APIs in the Baidu OpenEdge application will further enhance the capability of the Baidu OpenEdge based application as they can consume services like location, Radio network information etc. from the Edge Node. 

- IOT MQTT Data plane processing:
  (1) Device #1 publishes its status data by using MQTT protocol.
  (2) OpenNESS Platform forwards the traffic to Baidu OpenEdge according to traffic rule. Then Baidu OpenEdge will perform local computing and data filter.
  (3) According to topic configuration, Baidu OpenEdge sends data to Baidu Cloud.
  (4) Also Baidu OpenEdge forwards the message to device #2 sbuscriber.

### Run MQTT simulator

In the OpenNESS release package, it provides example scripts to help user for MQTT simulator and RTT testing. 
The scripts can be found in the release package with the subfolder name ```setup_baidu_openedge/mqtt ``` as below structure:

```docker
├── devices
│   ├── openedge_pub.py
│   └── openedge_sub.py
└── rtt
├── measure_rtt_iothub.py
└── measure_rtt_openedge.py
```

Before running the scripts, need install python3.6 and paho mqtt on CentOS Linux Machine (suggested version is: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)). 
Suggested install commands as below:

```docker
sudo yum -y install epel-release
sudo yum update
sudo yum install python36
sudo yum install python36-pip
sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt
```

#### Test OpenEdge Sub and Pub:

Data path is:

```docker
Device#1 publisher -> OpenNESS -> OpenEdge -> OpenNESS -> Deivce#2 Subscriber.
```

Run commands separately on the two devices's machines:

```docker
python3.6 openedge_pub.py -e [openedge_address] -c clientA -u test -s hahaha -t t
python3.6 openedge_sub.py -e [openedge_address] -c clientB -u test -s hahaha -t t/topic
```

*NOTE: [openedge_address] is ip address of OpenEdge gateway.*

Expected result on the subscriber:

```docker
Received Message of Topic t/topic
Message Content: b\'{\"wmId\": 0,\"aa\": b,\"cc\": {\"p\": 99,\"kk\":x}}\'
```

#### Test OpenEdge Route to IotHub:

Data path is:

```docker
Device#1 publisher -> OpenNESS -> OpenEdge -> IoTHub -> Deivce#2 Subscriber.
```

Run commands separately on the two devices's machines:

```docker
python3.6 openedge_sub.py -e [iothub_address] -c clientA -u [iothub_username] -s [iothub_password] -t t/topic
python3.6 openedge_pub.py -e [openedge_address] -c clientB -u test -s hahaha -t t
```

*NOTE: iothub_address, iothub_username and iothub_password will be got when registering user for Baidu IoTHub .*

Expected result on the subscriber:

```docker
Received Message of Topic t/topic
Message Content: b\'{\"wmId\": 0,\"aa\": b,\"cc\": {\"p\": 99,\"kk\":x}}\'
```

#### RTT Test with OpenEdge:

Data path is:

```docker
Device#1 publisher -> OpenNESS -> OpenEdge -> OpenNESS -> Deivce#1 Subscriber.
```

Run command on the one machine (Here only need device \#1 to play as publisher and subscriber):

```docker
python3.6 measure_rtt_openedge.py -e [openedge_address] -c clientRTT -u test -s hahaha -t t -b t/topic
```

*NOTE: \[openedge\_address\] is ip address of OpenEdge gateway.*

Expected result on the subscriber:

```docker
===receve message from topic: t/topic
avg delay (ms) = 1.7480066461309578
```

And the output statistics file is: rtt\_openedge.csv

#### RTT Test with IoTHub:

Data path is:

```docker
Device#1 publisher -> OpenNESS -> OpenEdge -> IoTHub -> Deivce#1 Subscriber.
```

Run command on the one machine (Here only need device \#1 to play as publisher and subscriber):

```docker
python3.6 measure_rtt_iothub.py -e [iothub_address] -c clientA -u [iothub_username] -s [iothub_password] -t rtt -b rtt
```

*NOTE: \[iothub\_address\] is ip address of Baidu IotHub. rtt is topic that is pre-configured on iotHub.*

Expected result on the subscriber:

```docker
===receve message from topic: t/topic

avg delay (ms) = 1.7480066461309578
```

And the output statistics file is: rtt\_iothub.csv
