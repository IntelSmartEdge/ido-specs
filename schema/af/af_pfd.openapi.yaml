        Possible values are
        - MALFUNCTION: This value indicates that something functions wrongly in PFD provisioning or the PFD provisioning does not function at all.
        - RESOURCE_LIMITATION: This value indicates there is resource limitation for PFD storage.
        - SHORT_DELAY: This value indicates that the allowed delay is too short and PFD(s) are not stored.
        - APP_ID_DUPLICATED: The received external application identifier(s) are already provisioned.
        - OTHER_REASON: Other reason unspecified.
