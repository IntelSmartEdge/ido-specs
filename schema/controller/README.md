# Controller API
## Introduction
Controller APIs are important APIs for those managing one or many edge nodes. These APIs allow centralize management of nodes. The API enables a developer to maintain a list of nodes, configure apps, manage policies and DNS, and more. The Controller API represents an abstraction layer for an operations administrator. While individual edge nodes may be managed singularly, the Controller API allows for management in a scalable way. Furthermore, it allows for secure communication to the many edge nodes.

The Controller API is implemented using HTTP REST.

## Contributing
If you wish to make contributions to this schema, please use the YAML version of the Swagger schema to do so. The JSON schema is only provided as a redundant reference and is **100% generated**. You **must** generate the JSON schema after making contributions to the YAML. In the future, this package may include tooling to do so automatically. For now, https://editor.swagger.io is a great tool which can generate the JSON for you from the YAML you've edited. Contributions that do not edit the YAML will not be considered. Contributions that do not have alignment between the YAML and JSON changes will also not be considered.
